# üöß WIP

Not available yet

## Installation

```sh
npm i -D @jill64/playwright-coverage
```

## Setup

1. Configure your bundler settings to output source maps

for example `vite`

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  build: {
    sourcemap: 'inline'
  }
})
```

> [!TIP]
>
> `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` is enabled only in coverage mode.

2. Use `@jill64/playwright-coverage/test` instead of `@playwright/test` in your tests

```diff
- import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
+ import { test, expect } from '@jill64/playwright-coverage/test'
```

## Usage

Run test command with `plc`(<u>**pl**</u>aywright <u>**c**</u>overage)

```sh
plc playwright test
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `playwright` coverage API is currently [supported by Chromium-based browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage).  
> If the test is run on a browser other than `chromium`, the test run will not be blocked, but a warning will be displayed in the console and no coverage will be collected.

## Options

If pass options to `plc`, before the test command.

```sh
plc --output coverage-result playwright test
```
