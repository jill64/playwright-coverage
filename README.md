<!----- END GHOST DOCS HEADER ----->

# üöß WIP

Not available yet

## Installation

```sh
npm i -D @jill64/playwright-coverage
```

## Setup

1. Configure your bundler settings to output source maps

for example in vite, 

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  build: {
    sourcemap: 'inline'
  }
})
```

> [!TIP]
>
> `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` is enabled only in coverage mode.

2. Use `@jill64/playwright-coverage/test` instead of `@playwright/test` in your tests

```diff
- import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
+ import { test, expect } from '@jill64/playwright-coverage/test'
```

3. Check where your server is serving files from.

4. The location is described in the `serve` option, either as an absolute path or relative to the `cwd`. If not specified, it is `cwd`.

## Usage

Run test command with `plc`(<u>**pl**</u>aywright <u>**c**</u>overage).
If pass options to `plc`, before the test command.

```sh
plc --serve /path/to/source playwright test
```

## Options

| option    | short | description          |
| --------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| --serve   | -s    | path to source root  |
| --output  | -o    | output directory     |
| --help    | -h    | show help            |
| --version | -v    | show version         |
| --quiet   | -q    | suppress log         |
| --debug   | -d    | debug mode           |

> [!NOTE]
>
> The playwright coverage API is currently [supported by Chromium-based browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-coverage).  
> If the test is run on a browser other than chromium, the test run will not be blocked, but a warning will be displayed in the console and no coverage will be collected.
